\item{time}{Time points at which an event occurred.}

\item{event}{The type of event that occurred. \code{NA} codes for no event.}

\item{levels}{Which levels of event to keep. Defaults to all unique

\description{
Heavily modeled after the \code{\link{Surv}} class in the `survival` package.
Objects of this class are internally stored as data frames but should be
thought of as vectors and can be treated as such through out.
}
\examples{
outcome(runif(15), sample(c(NA, "Mechanical failure", "Out of fuel"), 15, TRUE))
}
